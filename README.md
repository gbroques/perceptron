# Perceptron
Perceptron algorithm implemented in Python.

## Getting Started
This project depends upon the popular numerical processing library [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) for lightning-fast vector arithmetic, and other packages for unit testing.

### Prerequisites

To install NumPy, it's recommended you use Python's offical package manager **pip**.

To ensure pip is installed on your machine, run the command:

```
$ pip --version
```

pip should come installed with Python depending upon your version.

For more details, see [installation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/)
on pip's documentation.

### Installing
It's recommended you use `virtualenv` to create an isolated Python environment and manage per-project dependencies.

You can find details on [virtualenv's documentation](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/).

Once pip is installed, run:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install this project's dependencies on your machine.

## How to Run

```
$ python main.py -h
